# Migration Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the complete migration solution from the reference schema (production) to the merged schema (dev).

## Components Created

### 1. Migration Scripts

#### `scripts/migrate-reference-to-merged.ts` (Main Migration)
- **Purpose**: Transforms all data from prod (reference schema) to dev (merged schema)
- **Steps**: 8 sequential migration phases
  1. Migrants People with auto-created MeSpaces and FieldContexts
  2. Transforms Communities to WeSpaces
  3. Creates GoalPulses from Goals
  4. Creates ResourcePulses from Resources
  5. Creates StoryPulses from CarePoints
  6. Creates StoryPulses from CoreValues
  7. Transforms all relationships to ResonanceLinks
  8. Migrates SpaceMemberships
- **Features**:
  - Real-time progress logging
  - Detailed error tracking and reporting
  - Statistics summary
  - Handles edge cases gracefully

#### `scripts/validate-migration-setup.ts` (Pre-Migration Validation)
- **Purpose**: Validates both databases are ready before migration
- **Checks**:
  - ✅ Connectivity to both databases
  - ✅ Production data counts
  - ✅ Dev schema validity
  - ✅ No existing data in dev (warns if found)
- **Output**: Detailed validation report with pass/fail status

#### `scripts/MIGRATION_SCRIPTS_README.md` (Script Documentation)
- Complete reference guide for all migration scripts
- Workflow instructions
- Key mappings and auto-generated names
- Troubleshooting guide
- FAQ

## Migration Architecture

### Before Migration (Reference Schema)
```
Person
  ├─ firstName, lastName, email, phone, pronouns, location
  ├─ photo, avatar, status, inviteSent
  ├─ careManual, favorites, passions, traits, fieldsOfCare, interests
  ├─ MOTIVATED_BY → Goal
  ├─ PROVIDES → Resource
  ├─ EMBRACES → CoreValue
  ├─ CONNECTED_TO → Person
  └─ BELONGS_TO {totem, signupDate} → Community

Goal
  ├─ name, description, successMeasures, photo, activities, status, why, location, time
  ├─ APPLIED_TO ← Resource
  ├─ ALIGNED_TO → CoreValue
  ├─ ENABLES → CarePoint
  └─ CARES_FOR ← CarePoint

Community
  ├─ name, description, why, location, time, activities, resultsAchieved, status
  ├─ MOTIVATED_BY → Goal
  ├─ HAS_ACCESS_TO → Resource
  └─ EMBRACES → CoreValue

CarePoint & CoreValue (stored separately)
  └─ Contain multiple properties
```

### After Migration (Merged Schema)
```
Person (same 16 properties)
  ├─ OWNS → MeSpace
  ├─ IS_MEMBER → SpaceMembership → WeSpace
  └─ CREATED_BY → FieldContext

MeSpace
  └─ HAS_CONTEXT → FieldContext
       ├─ HAS_PULSE → GoalPulse (title, content, successMeasures, photo, activities, status, why, location, time)
       ├─ HAS_PULSE → ResourcePulse (title, content, status, why, location, time, resourceType, availability)
       ├─ HAS_PULSE → StoryPulse (title, content, + optional CarePoint/CoreValue properties)
       └─ HAS_RESONANCE → ResonanceLink
            ├─ label: "MOTIVATED_BY" | "APPLIED_TO" | "ALIGNED_TO" | etc.
            ├─ confidence: 1.0
            ├─ SOURCE → FieldPulse
            └─ TARGET → FieldPulse

WeSpace (Community → WeSpace)
  └─ HAS_CONTEXT → FieldContext
       └─ (same structure as MeSpace)

SpaceMembership
  ├─ role: "MEMBER"
  ├─ IS_MEMBER ← Person
  └─ HAS_MEMBER → Space
```

## Data Transformation Details

### People: 1 → 1 (with additions)
```
Person → Person (preserved) + MeSpace (created) + FieldContext (created)
```

### Communities: 1 → 1
```
Community → WeSpace (transformed with all properties merged)
All Community properties → WeSpace properties (description, why, location, time, activities, resultsAchieved, status)
```

### Goals: 1 → 1
```
Goal.name → GoalPulse.title
Goal.description → GoalPulse.content
All other Goal properties → GoalPulse properties (preserved)
Location: Legacy Goal -[:MOTIVATED_BY]-> Person → in Person's MeSpace FieldContext
```

### Resources: 1 → 1
```
Resource.name → ResourcePulse.title
Resource.description → ResourcePulse.content
All other properties → ResourcePulse properties (preserved)
Location: In provider's (Person or Community) FieldContext
```

### CarePoints: 1 → StoryPulse
```
CarePoint.name → StoryPulse.title
CarePoint.description → StoryPulse.content
All CarePoint properties → StoryPulse properties (all optional)
Properties: status, why, location, time, levelFulfilled, fulfillmentDate, successMeasures, issuesIdentified, issuesResolved
```

### CoreValues: 1 → StoryPulse
```
CoreValue.name → StoryPulse.title
CoreValue.description → StoryPulse.content
All CoreValue properties → StoryPulse properties (all optional)
Properties: alignmentChallenges, alignmentExamples, why
```

### Relationships: Many → ResonanceLink
```
Legacy Relationship → ResonanceLink { label: LegacyRelationshipName, confidence: 1.0 }
All 10 legacy relationship types preserved as labels
```

### Community Memberships: 1 → SpaceMembership
```
Person -[:BELONGS_TO]-> Community
→ Person -[:IS_MEMBER]-> SpaceMembership {role: "MEMBER"} -[:HAS_MEMBER]-> WeSpace
```

## Auto-Generated Names

### MeSpace Names
```
Pattern: "{firstName} {lastName} MeSpace"
Example: "Alice Smith MeSpace"
Purpose: Unique personal space for each user
```

### FieldContext Names in MeSpaces
```
Pattern: "{firstName}'s Goals"
Example: "Alice's Goals"
Purpose: Default context for user's pulses
```

### FieldContext Names in WeSpaces
```
Pattern: "{communityName} Field"
Example: "Tech Team Field"
Purpose: Context for community's shared pulses
```

## Running the Migration

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Validate setup
npx tsx scripts/validate-migration-setup.ts

# 2. Run migration (if validation passes)
npx tsx scripts/migrate-reference-to-merged.ts

# 3. Verify results (use queries from MIGRATION_VERIFICATION_QUERIES.md)
```

### Estimated Time
- Validation: 10-30 seconds
- Migration: Depends on data volume
  - Per entity: 100-300ms (network dependent)
  - 1,000 entities: ~5 minutes
  - 10,000 entities: ~30 minutes

## Next Steps

1. **Review documentation**
   - Read MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
   - Review PULSE_MIGRATION_PATTERN.md
   - Understand access patterns

2. **Prepare databases**
   - Ensure dev database has proper schema
   - Verify connectivity from your machine
   - Backup production database

3. **Run validation**
   - `npx tsx scripts/validate-migration-setup.ts`
   - Verify all checks pass

4. **Run migration**
   - `npx tsx scripts/migrate-reference-to-merged.ts`
   - Monitor progress
   - Review error report if any issues

5. **Verify results**
   - Run verification queries
   - Check data integrity
   - Validate access paths

6. **Update application**
   - Update database connections
   - Update queries to use new structure
   - Test authorization filters
   - Verify API endpoints

7. **Post-migration tasks**
   - Regenerate embeddings if needed
   - Update backups
   - Monitor performance
   - Document any custom handling

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **Important Considerations**

1. **Backup**: Backup production database before migration
2. **Test**: Run validation first, not directly to migration
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Don't run migration twice without cleanup
4. **Network**: Ensure stable connection to both databases
5. **Timing**: Run during low-traffic periods
6. **Monitoring**: Watch database performance during migration
7. **Rollback**: Keep rollback procedure in mind if needed
